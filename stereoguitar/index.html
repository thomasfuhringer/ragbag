<h1>Stereo Guitar 2.0</h1>

<p>
I modified a Telecaster guitar to output a stereo signal.<br> 
It plays the lower three strings on the left stereo channel and the treble strings on the right.<br>
That way it sounds somewhat like sitting in front of the piano in that you hear the lower notes more
 to your left and the higher ones to the right.<br>
The real point, however, is to run the two channels through a separate signal chain and thus account for the 
specific properties of the strings and frequency range and musical function of each voice register.
</p>
<p>To get that, I used a 'split blade' pickup, which has two coils in line. 
They are both connected but I tapped the signal between the two coils and run it out through a stereo jack.<br>
I put in a second tone pot so I can set a cutoff frequency (dial in a tone) for each of the channels.
Also the volume pot needed to be replaced with a stereo one.<br> 
To make it possible to switch back to mono, I swapped the pickup selector for a five-way 'Megaswitch', which allows for a lot of combinations.

</p>
<p>
Here is a bit of a demo of how it sounds:

I did the same with this Precision Bass. In this case it was simpler because it already comes with split coil pickups.
All I had to do was tap the wire between the two parts of the pickup and run it out through a stereo jack.<br>
I replaced one pot with a push-pull pot to switch between mono and stereo. Pushed in, the instrument behaves as it came from the factory.
</p>
<p>
In the case of a bass there might be less of a point in separating the signal because you do not play those arpeggios across the fretboard, which bring the stereo signal to shine.
But there might still be value in having a separate signal chain for the upper and lower two strings, e.g. to shape a two-part tone for slapping.
